\subsection{Simulations: Uniform
Ranks}\label{simulations-uniform-ranks}}

We conducted a simulation study to examine the rankings and scoring for
climbers in both qualification and final rounds. For each round, we
performed 10000 simulations, and this was accomplished by randomly
assigning the ranks of each event to every participant, with the
assumption that the ranks are uniformly distributed. After the
completion of the simulations, we calculated the final scores for every
simulated round, as well as the final standings for the climbing
athletes. This data would then enable us to answer questions about
various topics, including the distributions of scores for qualifying and
final rounds, and the probabilities of advancing to the finals or
winning a medal, given certain conditions.

\end{figure}

Conditional probability

From our simulations, the probability of advancing given winning the
first event is 0.9951, and the probability of advancing to the final
round for an athlete, given that they were the winner of at least one
event, is 0.9947.

Table 1 shows the average score of climbers that finished in the top 8
of the qualifying round and hence advanced to the final round.

\subsection{Correlations}\label{correlations}}

We collected data on major climbing competitions from 2018 to 2020,
including the 2020 Continental Championships of Europe, Africa, Oceania,
Pan-America; 2019 and 2018 World Championships; 2018 Asian Games; and
2018 Asian Games. We are interested in looking at the relationships
between the ranks of the individual events and the final standings, and
we computed Kendall's Tau (Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient).

Table is a correlation matrix between the ranks for the 2018 Youth
Olympics Women's Qualification.

It is evidently clear that there is a strong and positive correlation
between the ranks of bouldering and lead climbing, and as a results, the
standings of these two events are highly correlated with the final
rankings. On the other hand, the relationship is not as strong for speed
climbing. Thus, speed climbers are facing a huge disadvantage in this
scoring system, compared to those that are specialized in the other two
concentrations.
